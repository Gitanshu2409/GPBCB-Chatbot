# GPBCB-Chatbot
GPBCB for GP's Basic Chatbot (Still in Developing State).
I thought to only make it chat with the user but the first specimen failed.
So, i changed the approach which solved the problem as well as gave this chatbot multi functionalities (Chat + Math + Random Fact).
Now given files are the full fledged first release please compile and try.
Compiler + OS - openjdk-17-jdk on Ubuntu 20.04 Focal (LTS) x64 with kernel version 5.15.0-53-generic (Please Recomplie to run.)
